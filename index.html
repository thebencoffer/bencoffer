<h1>Opioid crisis at local Carver residence</h1>
<p>Phishing - the fraudulent practice of sending emails pretending to be from real companies in order to induce individuals to reveal personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers
Flaming - hostile and insulting interaction between persons over the Internet, often involving the use of profanity
Spamming - the practice of sending unwanted email messages, frequently with commercial content
These three words are similar because they relate to unwanted and often unsolicited interactions online. All of these words carry a negative connotation and are prominent in everyday computer usage. These three words are different based on their use and interactions with the consumer. Phishing and flaming require the receiver to respond back in order to work, while spamming is often just unread emails from service providers that prove no real need to the consumer. Although both flaming and spamming are bad, phishing has the potential to become the worst out of the three if/when the consumer responds and starts to give away his or her personal information; which can lead to money loss and identity theft.
